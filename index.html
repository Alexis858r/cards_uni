                        <h2>What is Kirby?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Kirby (カービイ Kābī in Japanese) is a character of the great company Nintendo and the protagonist of a series of games with the same name. He was created by Masahiro Sakurai. He made his first appearance in 1992 on the Game Boy handheld console. Since then Kirby appeared in different consoles with 2D games until Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards was released, where Kirby can be seen in 3D. Kirby also has an anime series: Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, which aired on October 6, 2001. He is recognized by his round shape and his characteristic pink color.

                        <h2>What is King Dedede?</h2>
                        <p>
                            King Dedede, also written as King DeDeDe or King De De De (in certain older games), is Kirby's arch-rival and a main character in Nintendo and HAL Laboratory's long-running Kirby video game series. He (or something in his likeness) has appeared in every game in the series except Kirby & The Amazing Mirror. As such, he is one of the most recurring characters in the series besides Kirby, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, Waddle Dee, Kracko, and Whispy Woods. Due to his many roles as Kirby's main adversary, many consider Dedede to be the series antagonist. Despite this, he has helped more than harmed since Kirby's Return to Dream Land, and Nintendo has even described Dedede as Kirby's "arch-frenemy.

                        <h2>What is Meta Knight?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Meta Knight is a major character in the Kirby series, appearing in most of the games, the manga, as well as the anime since his debut in Kirby's Adventure in 1993. The intrigue and popularity surrounding Meta Knight within the Kirby fandom largely lies in his enigmatic and solitary, yet caring nature, and his mysterious, yet striking likeness to Kirby himself.

                        <h2>What is Waddle Dee?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Waddle Dees are species native to Planet Popstar. As some of the most common inhabitants of Dream Land they appear as both enemies and friendly NPCs. Many, but not all, Waddle Dees loyally serve King Dedede, the self-proclaimed ruler of Dream Land, and he often involves them in his schemes. As an enemy, they are both the most basic and most common regular enemy, and a staple of the Kirby series, with Waddle Dee or some variant thereof appearing in every game since the first ever Kirby title, Kirby's Dream Land.

                            Waddle Doos are common enemies in the Kirby series. They are cycloptic variants of Waddle Dee that fire energy whips from their eye to attack. If Kirby inhales one, he gets the Beam ability.
